Show and Sort All Lync Chat Rooms (GUI)
=======================================

            

By request.  Just a simple PowerShell GUI to show and sort persistent chat rooms, including disabled rooms.  This information can be difficult to view from a PowerShell window and isn't available directly in the Lync console. 


Please feel free to take the script and modify it to suit your needs, or ask me to make enhancements or modifications to it (I'd be happy to!).  This is best run from a Lync server, however anywhere you have the Lync Management Shell installed is fine.


Usage: Just double click, please be patient, it can take a bit of time for Lync to return the data while the form loads.


v1.01 update: Swapped out custom GUI for Out-GridView for now.  Might swap back in custom GUI if additional functionality is warranted.
